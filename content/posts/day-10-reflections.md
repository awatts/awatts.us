## Guitar

I don't have too much to say on the guitar front. I've done the first 6 days of
Guitareo's ["Iconic Chord Progressions"](https://www.musora.com/guitareo/challenge/iconic-chord-progressions/415525/).
So far it's been

1. "Pop" I V vi iv
2. "50's" I vi iv V
3. "Jazz" I vi ii V
4. "Punk" I V IV V
5. "Other Pop" vi iv I V
6. "Alt Rock" I IIIb VIIb V

Nothing earthshaking about it. Just good to practice chord progressions and changing
chords in fluid playing. I've been plugging my guitar into the computer with an
iRig HD and using [Amplitube](https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/amplitube5cs/)
to get a basic amp tone and throw in a virtual distortion pedal for some grit on
the "Punk" and "Alt Rock" days. Much moreso than with Rocksmith, I can have my
volume above the backing volume and really hear what I'm playing and the mistakes
I'm making so I can work to correct them.

Oh, and I bought a looper pedal. I'd love to get to the point where I can make a
clean loop of one of the progressions and practice playing something else on top.

## Drums

I've been sticking with the [30 Day Drummer Level II](https://www.musora.com/drumeo/challenge/30-day-drummer-level-ii/415524)
challenge. Week one has been working up to doing a four on the floor bass drum
with snare on 2 & 4, sometime switching to cross sticks, 8th notes on the hi hat,
opening on the & of 4, and on day 5 adding in a crash on 1 instead of a hi hat every
4 bars.

It has been a bit of an experience, because this is the first thing I've done on
my electronic drum kit and the first thing I've done since 30 Day Drummer last year
on the practice pad. I'm noticing a lot of technique issues. To start with, it took
me a couple days before I could do the 4 on the floor, and then another day to be
able to switch between it and 1 & 3. Still maybe 65% on opening the hi hat on the
& of 4. Cross sticking has been weird because my kit tries to detect whether your
hand is on the head to choose between a rim shot and cross stick and it isn't perfect,
so it's really jarring when a random rim shot plays.

But also I'm noticing how bad my dynamics are. I need to sit down and just practice
playing each drum and cymbal (especially kick and snare) with different dynamics
and just be consistent and intentional.

Today I went down and slightly rearranged the kit. I noticed from watching some
Drumeo videos that I have the snare too far back and the kick pedal and hi hat
too far away. Next time I go down to practice I'm hoping the tweaking makes it
easier to play

## Music reading / Piano

This has been interesting because I wasn't originally planning to do this. But
being able to read music is important if you want to get away from just tabs.

Frankly, it has been extremely hard for me. The first couple of days doing one
hand at a time and mostly chromatic, 3rds or 5ths was easy. But then it started
mixing in two hands and then two hands doing different things. And it's fallen
apart pretty badly the last few days.

Thankfully, the [Read Music in 30 Days](https://www.musora.com/pianote/challenge/read-music-in-30-days/410337)
page has a downloadable PDF. So last night I printed out days 8-11 so I can work
on them outside of the lessons and potentially mark them up with a pencil in the
spots where I'm struggling. Today was the first day of week 3 (they're doing 5 day
weeks) and I took the instructor's advice and just did one hand because I was
stuggling. What I noticed doing that is that I am really dying on treble clef but
bass clef is relatively ok. I think I'm going to take the printouts and both write
finger numbers (especially on the right hand) but maybe on the notes I keep missing,
I'll write the note name so I can work on internalizing them.

## Mandolin

I just did the mandolin one day, taking the first song ("The Blue Danube") in
the Hal Leonard Mandolin Playalong [Classical Themes](https://www.halleonard.com/product/156777/classical-themes)
book. I'd love to return to it later, but it's bottom priority right now.

## Final notes for the (10 day) week

One thing that has really stood out to me is that trying to do three things each day
is insane. Once one of these Musora challanges ends (I think the guitar progressions
is first), I'm going to stick to no more than two things on a given day, even if
I alternate a bit day to day.
